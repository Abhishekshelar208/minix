## 🚀 How It Works

### **1. Team Leader Creates Project**

```
Leader → Create Project Space
      → Add team members (name + email)
      → Click "Create Project Space"
      
System → Creates project in Firebase
      → Adds leader to ProjectMembers (role: 'leader')
      → Adds project to leader's UserProjects
      → Sends invitations to all members
      → Shows success: "✅ Project created! 📧 Invitations sent to 2 member(s)"
```

### **2. Team Members Receive Invitations**

```
Member → Opens Minix app
       → Sees invitation banner on Home screen:
       
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔔 Pending Invitations (1)                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  📋 Tech Innovators                          │
│  John Doe invited you to join                │
│  App • Year 3 • Student Project              │
│  [✓ Accept]  [✗ Decline]                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **3. Accept Invitation**

```
Member → Clicks "Accept"
       
System → Updates invitation status to 'accepted'
      → Adds member to ProjectMembers (role: 'member')
      → Adds project to member's UserProjects
      → Shows success: "✅ Joined Tech Innovators successfully!"
      → Refreshes home screen
      → Project appears in member's project list
```

### **4. Collaborate**

```
Leader → Selects topic (Step 1)
Member → Opens app → Sees selected topic
Member → Continues to Step 2 (Naming)
Leader → Opens app → Sees member's work
       → Real-time sync!
```
