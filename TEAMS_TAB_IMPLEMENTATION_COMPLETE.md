User Interface
```

### **Database Structure:**

```

### **State Management:**
- **StreamBuilder** for real-time data
- **setState** for local UI updates
- **Stream** subscriptions for Firebase
- **Future** for async operations

### **Services Layer:**
```dart
TeamService:
  - getTeamMembers(projectSpaceId) → Stream<List<TeamMember>>
  - getTeamActivities(projectSpaceId) → Stream<List<TeamActivity>>
  - updateMemberRole(projectSpaceId, userId, role)
  - removeMember(projectSpaceId, userId)
  - promoteToCoLeader(projectSpaceId, userId)
  - demoteToMember(projectSpaceId, userId)
  - logActivity(projectSpaceId, type, description)
  - canManageTeam(projectSpaceId) → bool
  - getTeamStats(projectSpaceId) → Map<String, int>
```
