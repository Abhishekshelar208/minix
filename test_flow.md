# Complete Project Flow Test Guide

## Testing Steps for Mini Project Helper

### 1. **Initial Launch & Authentication**
- [ ] App opens to splash screen with proper branding
- [ ] If not logged in: shows intro slides with app features
- [ ] Google Sign-In works properly
- [ ] User data is saved to Firebase
- [ ] Navigates to Home Screen after successful login

### 2. **Home Screen - New User**
- [ ] Shows welcome card with project journey messaging
- [ ] "Start Your First Project" button is visible
- [ ] Stats cards show 0 values for new user
- [ ] No project spaces shown initially

### 3. **Step 1: Project Space Creation**
- [ ] Clicking "Create Project Space" navigates correctly
- [ ] Can enter team name (validation works)
- [ ] Can select year of study (difficulty auto-adjusts)
- [ ] Can select target platform (App/Web/Website)
- [ ] Can add team members (validation works)
- [ ] "Create Project Space" button creates space successfully
- [ ] Navigates to Topic Selection automatically

### 4. **Step 2: Topic Selection**
- [ ] Shows project space info in header
- [ ] Can select domain from available options
- [ ] Can enter year of study
- [ ] Can select multiple technologies
- [ ] Can add custom technologies
- [ ] "Search Topics" generates AI-powered problems
- [ ] Can view problem details in modal
- [ ] Can bookmark problems
- [ ] "Select Topic" saves problem and navigates to name suggestions

### 5. **Step 3: Project Name Suggestions**
- [ ] Shows selected problem info in header
- [ ] AI generates 6-8 creative project names
- [ ] Can select from suggested names
- [ ] Can enter custom project name
- [ ] Selected name is saved and navigates to roadmap

### 6. **Step 4: Roadmap Generation**
- [ ] Shows team information correctly
- [ ] Shows selected technologies from problem
- [ ] Can select project deadline
- [ ] "Generate AI Roadmap" creates comprehensive task list
- [ ] Tasks are properly distributed across timeline
- [ ] Tasks have proper priorities, categories, and assignments
- [ ] Can mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- [ ] Progress percentage updates correctly
- [ ] Returns to Home Screen with completed project

### 7. **Home Screen - With Projects**
- [ ] Stats cards show correct counts
- [ ] Project spaces display with enhanced cards
- [ ] Progress bars show correct percentages
- [ ] Current step indicators are accurate
- [ ] Action buttons work ("Continue" vs "View Roadmap")
- [ ] Current roadmap section shows active tasks
- [ ] Can complete tasks from home screen

### 8. **Navigation Flow Continuation**
- [ ] "Continue" button navigates to correct step based on current progress
- [ ] Step 1: Goes to Topic Selection
- [ ] Step 2: Goes to Project Name Suggestions (with problem data)
- [ ] Step 3: Goes to Roadmap Generation (with all data)
- [ ] Step 4: Goes to Roadmap View (completed project)

### 9. **Data Persistence**
- [ ] All project data persists across app restarts
- [ ] Firebase database structure is correct
- [ ] User can have multiple project spaces
- [ ] Each project maintains its own state
- [ ] Task completion status persists

### 10. **Error Handling**
- [ ] Network errors show appropriate messages
- [ ] AI generation failures show fallback options
- [ ] Missing data scenarios are handled gracefully
- [ ] User can retry failed operations

## Expected Firebase Database Structure

```

  {uid}/
    name: "User Name"
    emailID: "email@example.com"
    photoURL: "https://..."
    provider: "Google"
    joinDate: timestamp

  {projectSpaceId}/
    ownerId: {uid}
    teamName: "Team Name"
    teamMembers: ["Member 1", "Member 2"]
    yearOfStudy: 2
    targetPlatform: "App"
    difficulty: "Intermediate"
    currentStep: 4
    status: "RoadmapCreated"
    problemId: "ai_123_0"
    problemTitle: "Problem Title"
    problemDescription: "Description"
    problemDomain: "College"
    problemSkills: ["Flutter", "Firebase"]
    projectName: "Project Name"
    selectedProblemTitle: "Problem Title"
    roadmapId: "roadmap_123"
    createdAt: timestamp

    {problemId}: true
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete Flow**: User can create project space → select topic → choose name → generate roadmap  
✅ **Data Persistence**: All data saves correctly to Firebase  
✅ **Home Screen**: Shows proper project status and navigation  
✅ **AI Integration**: Topic generation and roadmap creation work  
✅ **Task Management**: Can track and complete roadmap tasks  
✅ **User Experience**: Smooth navigation and clear progress indicators  

## Notes for Testing

1. **API Key**: Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set for AI features
2. **Firebase**: Verify Firebase configuration is correct
3. **Network**: Test with both good and poor network conditions
4. **Data Volume**: Test with multiple projects and large task lists
5. **Edge Cases**: Test with minimal data, long names, special characters

This comprehensive test ensures the entire project creation and management workflow functions correctly.
