# Team Leader Feature Implementation Summary

## üéØ Feature Overview
Implemented comprehensive team leader functionality where:
- **Team leaders** can make any changes to project steps
- **Team members** have read-only access (can view but not edit)
- Team leaders are designated during project space creation

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Project Space Creation Updates** (`project_space_creation_page.dart`)
- ‚úÖ Changed `_teamMembers` from `List<Map<String, String>>` to `List<Map<String, dynamic>>` to support `isLeader` boolean field
- ‚úÖ Added `isLeader: false` default when adding new team members
- ‚úÖ Created **star toggle button** next to each team member to mark them as leader
- ‚úÖ Added **yellow "LEADER" badge** that displays for members marked as leaders
- ‚úÖ Visual: Filled yellow star = leader, gray outlined star = member

### 2. **Invitation System Updates**
#### `project_invitation.dart` (Model)
- ‚úÖ Added `isLeader` field to `ProjectInvitation` model
- ‚úÖ Updated `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to include `isLeader`
- ‚úÖ Added `isLeader` to `copyWith()` method

#### `invitation_service.dart` (Service)
- ‚úÖ Added `isLeader` parameter to `sendInvitation()` method (defaults to `false`)
- ‚úÖ Updated `sendBulkInvitations()` to accept and pass through `isLeader` flag
- ‚úÖ Modified `acceptInvitation()` to determine role from invitation (`leader` or `member`)
- ‚úÖ **New Method**: `canEditProject(projectSpaceId)` - checks if current user is a leader
- ‚úÖ **New Method**: `isProjectCreator(projectSpaceId)` - checks if user created the project
- ‚úÖ **New Method**: `getProjectPermissions(projectSpaceId)` - returns comprehensive permission details

### 3. **Read-Only UI Component** (`read_only_banner.dart`)
- ‚úÖ Created reusable `ReadOnlyBanner` widget
- ‚úÖ Displays eye icon with amber warning color scheme
- ‚úÖ Shows "Read-Only Mode: Only team leaders can make changes" message
- ‚úÖ Includes "VIEWER" badge on the right

### 4. **Reference Implementation** (`project_solution_page.dart`)
- ‚úÖ Added permission checking in `initState()`
- ‚úÖ Added `_canEdit` and `_isCheckingPermissions` state variables
- ‚úÖ Displayed `ReadOnlyBanner` for non-leaders
- ‚úÖ Disabled all action buttons for non-leaders:
  - Generate AI Solutions button
  - Refresh solutions button  
  - Select solution button
  - Proceed to Roadmap button
- ‚úÖ Disabled text fields in custom solution form
- ‚úÖ Updated tooltips to explain why actions are disabled

### 5. **Documentation**
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive implementation guide (`TEAM_LEADER_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE.md`)
- ‚úÖ Includes step-by-step instructions for adding permissions to other pages
- ‚úÖ Provides code examples and common patterns
- ‚úÖ Lists all pages that need permission implementation
- ‚úÖ Includes troubleshooting section

## üèóÔ∏è Database Structure

### ProjectMembers Node
```
ProjectMembers/
  {projectSpaceId}/
    {userId}/
      - userId: string
      - name: string
      - email: string
      - role: "leader" | "member"  ‚Üê Key field
      - joinedAt: timestamp
      - isActive: boolean
```

### UserProjects Node
```
UserProjects/
  {userId}/
    {projectSpaceId}/
      - projectSpaceId: string
      - role: "leader" | "member"  ‚Üê Key field
      - joinedAt: timestamp
```

### ProjectInvitations Node
```
ProjectInvitations/
  {projectSpaceId}/
    {invitationId}/
      - invitationId: string
      - memberEmail: string
      - memberName: string
      - status: "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected"
      - isLeader: boolean  ‚Üê New field
      - sentAt: timestamp
```

## üé® Visual Elements

### Team Leader Badge
- **Color**: Yellow (#eab308)
- **Text**: "LEADER" in bold white text
- **Placement**: Next to member name in lists

### Star Toggle Button
- **Active**: Filled yellow star (#eab308) on light yellow background
- **Inactive**: Gray outlined star on transparent background
- **Purpose**: Toggle team leader status during member addition

### Read-Only Banner
- **Background**: Amber (#f59e0b) at 10% opacity
- **Icon**: Eye icon in amber
- **Badge**: "VIEWER" label in amber
- **Border**: Bottom border in amber

## üîß How It Works

### Project Creation Flow
1. User creates project space and adds team members
2. For each member, user can click star icon to mark as team leader
3. Yellow badge appears next to marked leaders
4. When project is created:
   - Creator is automatically set as leader (role: 'leader')
   - Invitations are sent with `isLeader` flag based on star toggle

### Invitation Acceptance Flow
1. Invited member receives notification in app
2. When they accept:
   - Role is set based on `invitation.isLeader` field
   - If `isLeader = true`, role becomes 'leader'
   - If `isLeader = false`, role becomes 'member'
3. User is added to `ProjectMembers` with appropriate role

### Permission Checking Flow
1. Page loads and calls `_checkPermissions()` in `initState()`
2. Service checks user's role in `ProjectMembers` node
3. If role is 'leader', `_canEdit = true`
4. If role is 'member', `_canEdit = false`
5. UI updates based on `_canEdit` state:
   - Shows/hides read-only banner
   - Enables/disables buttons and fields

## üìã Remaining Work

### Pages Needing Permission Implementation
The following pages should implement the same permission pattern:
- [ ] `topic_selection_page.dart`
- [ ] `project_name_suggestions_page.dart`
- [ ] `project_roadmap_page.dart`
- [ ] `code_generation_page.dart`
- [ ] `ppt_generation_page.dart`
- [ ] `project_documentation_page.dart`
- [ ] `viva_preparation_page.dart`

**Note**: Follow the guide in `TEAM_LEADER_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE.md` for implementation.

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios
1. **As Project Creator (Automatic Leader)**
   - Create a project space
   - Verify you can edit all steps
   - Verify no read-only banner appears

2. **As Invited Team Leader**
   - Be added with leader toggle ON (yellow star)
   - Accept invitation
   - Verify you can edit all steps
   - Verify no read-only banner appears

3. **As Regular Team Member**
   - Be added with leader toggle OFF (gray star)
   - Accept invitation
   - Verify read-only banner appears
   - Verify all buttons are disabled
   - Verify text fields are read-only
   - Verify tooltips show helpful messages

4. **Multiple Leaders**
   - Add multiple team members as leaders
   - Verify all can edit simultaneously
   - Verify each sees edit permissions

5. **Permission Changes**
   - Test what happens if role is changed in Firebase
   - App should respect current role on next load

## üîê Security Considerations

### Frontend Protection
- ‚úÖ UI elements disabled for non-leaders
- ‚úÖ Clear visual feedback with read-only banner
- ‚úÖ Helpful tooltips explain restrictions

### Backend Protection (TODO)
**Important**: Firebase Security Rules should be updated to enforce permissions:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "ProjectSpaces": {
      "$projectId": {
        ".write": "auth != null && data.child('ProjectMembers').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() === 'leader'"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Key Files Modified

1. `lib/pages/project_space_creation_page.dart` - Added leader toggle UI
2. `lib/models/project_invitation.dart` - Added isLeader field
3. `lib/services/invitation_service.dart` - Permission checking methods
4. `lib/widgets/read_only_banner.dart` - New read-only UI component
5. `lib/pages/project_solution_page.dart` - Reference implementation
6. `lib/docs/TEAM_LEADER_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide

## üí° Usage Instructions

### For Project Creators
1. Navigate to "Create Project Space"
2. Add team members with name and email
3. Click the **star icon** next to any member to make them a team leader
4. Yellow star = leader, gray star = member
5. Create the project space

### For Team Members
- **Leaders**: Full access to edit all project steps
- **Members**: Can view all steps but cannot make changes
- Both can see the same project information and progress

## üìû Support & Questions

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `TEAM_LEADER_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE.md` for implementation details
2. Reference `project_solution_page.dart` for working example
3. Verify database structure in Firebase console
4. Ensure user roles are correctly set in `ProjectMembers` node

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Allow original creator to change member roles
- [ ] Add UI to view and manage team member roles
- [ ] Implement role change history/audit log
- [ ] Add "co-leader" or "contributor" intermediate role
- [ ] Email notifications when role changes
