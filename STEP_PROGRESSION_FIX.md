# ðŸ”§ Step Progression Fix - Documentation to Viva Preparation

## Issue Description
After successfully generating documents in **Step 7: Documentation**, the next step (**Step 8: Viva Preparation**) was not getting enabled in the project steps navigation.

## Root Cause
In the `ProjectDocumentationPage` at line 143, after successful document generation, the code was updating the current step to `7` instead of `8`:

```dart
// BEFORE (Incorrect)
await _projectService.updateCurrentStep(widget.projectSpaceId, 7);
```

This meant that after completing documentation, the system thought the user was still on Step 7, so Step 8 (Viva Preparation) remained disabled.

## Solution Applied
Updated the step progression logic to advance to Step 8 after successful document generation:

```dart
// AFTER (Correct) 
await _projectService.updateCurrentStep(widget.projectSpaceId, 8);
```

## Files Modified
1. **`lib/pages/project_documentation_page.dart`**
   - **Line 143:** Changed step update from `7` to `8`
   - **Line 275:** Updated UI text from "Step 6" to "Step 7" for consistency

## Project Steps Flow (Corrected)
1. **Step 1:** Topic Selection âœ…
2. **Step 2:** Name Selection âœ…
3. **Step 3:** Solution Design âœ…
4. **Step 4:** Roadmap Generation âœ…
5. **Step 5:** Prompt Generation âœ…
6. **Step 6:** PPT Generation âœ…
7. **Step 7:** Documentation âœ… â†’ *Now correctly advances to Step 8*
8. **Step 8:** Viva Preparation âœ… â†’ *Now gets enabled after documentation*

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User completes document generation in Step 7
2. System updates `currentStep` to `8` in Firebase
3. User returns to Project Steps page
4. Step 8 (Viva Preparation) becomes enabled and clickable
5. User can proceed to Viva Preparation

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to a project in Step 7 (Documentation)
2. Generate any document (Report, PPT, Synopsis, or User Manual)
3. Wait for "âœ… Document generated successfully!" message
4. Return to Project Steps page
5. Verify that **Step 8: Viva Preparation** is now enabled (blue icon, clickable)
6. Click on Viva Preparation to confirm it works

## Status: âœ… FIXED
The step progression issue has been resolved. Users can now smoothly progress from Documentation (Step 7) to Viva Preparation (Step 8) without any interruption in their project workflow.
